Gold layer
Delivers refined data optimized for specific business insights and decision making. The Gold layer involves aggregating, summarizing, and enriching data to support high-level reporting and analytics. This layer focuses on performance, usability, and scalability, providing fast access to key metrics and insights.
Its key characteristics are that it’s highly curated and optimized for consumption, so the data in the Gold layer supports strategic business operations and decisions.

## Star Schema
    - Star schemas will likely address most of your needs. They excel at conducting complex analyses on historical data and transforming data into entities such as an OLAP cube (a multidimensional data array based on online analytical processing). 
    
    - When you design star schemas, remember that their role extends beyond just boosting performance. They are shaped based on how users interact with data. Think of your data model as a public interface, similar to an API or a function. 
    
    - It’s essential to make this interface intuitive and logically structured, just like any tool designed for user interaction. This way, users can navigate and utilize the data more effectively.

    - In Kimball methodology, there are two key types of tables used to organize and manage data:
        - Fact table
            A fact table is the central table in a star schema. A fact table stores quantitative data for analysis and is designed to be compact, fast, and adaptable.
        - Dimension table
            Dimension tables are used to describe dimensions of the facts; they provide the context for the data. In essence, dimension tables store attributes related to the measurements in the fact tables, which helps in making the data understandable and readable.

    - Loading the star schema involves two primary tasks: loading the dimension tables and loading the fact tables. These steps are crucial for operationalizing the schema to support business analysis and decision-making processes. 
        - Loading the dimension tables
            Loading dimension tables in a star schema is complicated by the need to handle SCDs, an incremental process that involves comparing incoming data with the existing data in the dimension table.

            After harmonizing the records, they are ready for insertion into the dimension table. This process might involve several hops or stages. 
        - Loading the fact tables
            The primary task involves replacing the business keys, which describe business transactions, with surrogate keys linked to the dimension tables. Each row in the fact table includes foreign key references to rows in the dimension tables.

            It’s crucial to create the dimension tables before the fact tables because fact tables rely on dimension tables for their surrogate keys. Without the presence of business keys in the dimension tables, it becomes impossible to locate and assign the appropriate surrogate keys.

            early arriving fact. In such cases, the creation of placeholder records becomes necessary. These records represent the missing entries and help maintain the integrity of the relationships between the dimension and fact tables, ensuring the star schema functions correctly.
    - Optimizing loads
        When loading a star schema, various bottlenecks can occur, such as excessively long lookup times that force users to endure lengthy waits. To address this issue, you can optimize the data processing by incorporating administrative columns into your tables. For example, adding columns like type1_hash and type2_hash can streamline the detection of type 1 and type 2 changes during the ETL process.

        In a SCD1 model, you overwrite the old value with the new one, keeping no history. 
        The SCD2 model preserves both current and historical records within the same file or table.
    - Star Schema Design Nuances
        there is significant diversity in how different organizations manage their models. Let’s explore some alternative approaches to give you a broader perspective on the possibilities.
        - Curated, Semantic, and Platinum Layers
            For example, some organizations might add extra conformed or curation layers, with separate (semantic) layers for data marts that use star schemas. 
            
            Occasionally, these additional layers are called Platinum layers, highlighting their specialized and highly refined nature. 
            
            In such setups, it’s common for organizations to follow some type of enterprise data modeling, like creating standard reference tables and conformed dimensions, which can be used across multiple data marts within a larger lakehouse architecture. 
            
            Despite being considered complex and time-consuming, this approach remains popular because it ensures data reusability and standardization across different parts of the organization.
        
        - One-Big-Table Design
            OBT involves storing all relevant data for analysis or operations in a single, large table. This method avoids distributing data across multiple tables or organizing it according to more complex schemas, such as star or snowflake schemas.

            - Easier to manage
                OBT is often simpler to manage and understand, particularly for those who are not specialists in data warehousing. 
            - Better performance
                For certain types of queries, especially those that do not require aggregating large volumes of data from various dimensions, a single big table can offer better performance. The elimination of joins that would be necessary in a star schema can lead to faster query execution times.
            - Flexible schema
                A single big table provides a flexible schema that can be easier to modify and extend compared to a more rigid star schema. This can be particularly valuable in fast-paced environments where business requirements change frequently, necessitating quick adjustments to the data model.
            - Preferred by data scientists
                Designs featuring one large table can also be preferred by data scientists who work with tools that expect data in one flat format. These OBT designs also offer convenience
                when transforming data into vector or graph-based datasets for modeling.
            - Great for long-term analysis
                For datasets that inherently track changes over time (like sales or user activity data), a single, large table can make time-series analysis more straightforward. Analysts can observe historical trends and make future predictions based on a continuous stream of data.

## Serving Layer
    you might still find it necessary to replicate data across other types of databases, in addition to lakehouses, using Delta tables.

    Lakehouse architectures often employ a diverse mix of technology services to satisfy various needs effectively. 
        - A typical lakehouse architecture includes serverless compute for ad hoc querying, Spark for big data processing, and Delta tables where the bulk of the data is stored. 
        - Relational databases might be used for handling more complex queries, time-series databases that cater to the Internet of Things (IoT) and streaming analysis, and reporting cubes like Power BI for facilitating analytics and visualization. 

    The decision to complement the Gold layer with an additional layer using other database technologies often hinges on usability, compatibility with other services, flexibility, performance, and cost considerations.

## The Gold Layer in Practice
To achieve this, aligning closely with data governance is crucial to maintain compliance, integrity, and security. It’s important to document and catalog all datasets, maintain
transparency about how data is used, and segment data for specific use cases. Clearly defining roles and responsibilities within this framework also ensures accountability and adherence to best practices.


Steps:
1. Once you’ve defined the subject area you’re focusing on, determine the central fact table(s). This table should contain key measurements or metrics for analysis, such as sales, revenue, or customer counts. 
2. Next, you should design the dimension tables to provide context for the facts, with attributes like time, geography, product, or customer. 
3. Finally, you should establish relationships between the fact and dimension tables using foreign keys to complete the schema. 

It is important to note that when loading data into the star schema, you must always start with the dimension tables, followed by the fact table(s). This sequence is crucial to maintain the integrity of the key relationships.


Good practices:

- Simplify for non-SQL users
    For end users or data scientists who are not well-versed in SQL, a single, large table may be easier to understand than a star schema, even though it may not be as efficient for queries and maintenance. Additionally, creating a semantic model that features tables and columns with
    user-friendly names can also help those unfamiliar with SQL. Therefore, your Gold layer might include additional sublayers designed to be more accessible and user- friendly.

- Improve data quality
    Incorporating an additional data quality step in the Gold layer is strongly recommended, following the cleaning and joining of data in the Silver layer, to ensure the successful construction of the integrated dataset.

    Furthermore, to ensure records can be accurately joined, you could ingest a placeholder record into each dimension in the Silver layer. This record would have a value of 0 for each column, making it easier to identify and address any missing data in the Gold layer. This is for situations where there is not a dimension record for an ID in the fact table. This placeholder record would help to identify the missing data and ensure the join is still successful.

- Enhance performance
    Adding partitioning to the schema could improve query performance by reducing the data volume scanned during queries. Another performance improvement could be
    implemented by using smaller lookup tables for retrieving the hashes of the dimension tables. This would reduce the amount of data scanned during joins.

- Include auditing and processing columns
    Adding columns like created_at , updated_at , and source_system to both fact and dimension tables helps
    track data lineage and facilitate troubleshooting.

- Implement data security measures
    You can introduce columns for row-level security to restrict data access based on user roles or permissions. For example, for the AdventureWorks database, you could introduce an additional HumanResources.Employee table to restrict data access based on the department each employee belongs to. You could then use the system function to match the LoginID in the
    table, determining which data the user can access. See Microsoft Fabric and Power BI for more information on row-level security.

- Consider additional layers
    Depending on the complexity of the data and the needs of the users, you might need to introduce additional layers (with fit-for-purpose tables) within the Gold layer. These layers could be for different use cases or business units; different applications might have varying requirements regarding data structure, granularity, or aggregation levels. These sublayers can be optimized individually, for instance by partitioning based on the usage characteristics. You could do something similar for overlapping requirements. You could create a common integration layer with conformed dimensions and data that is often input for different use cases. Then, you could add sublayers for specific use cases that require additional data or different aggregations.

-  Consider a physical serving layer
    Depending on the complexity of the data and the needs of the users, you might need to introduce a physical serving layer. This is where data is copied from the Gold layer into one or more services as a way to make it easier for end users to access—products such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, or a database for real-time intelligence.

    When it comes to technology architecture, particularly for the serving layer, it’s crucial to understand that choosing a database or service is a complex procedure. It requires considering various factors and making numerous
    compromises. Beyond data structure, you’ll need to assess your requirements in terms of consistency, availability, caching, timeliness, and indexing for enhanced performance. There are a variety of methods for storing and retrieving data, such as using small or large chunks, sorted chunks, etc. Contrary to what some enthusiasts may suggest, no single service can perfectly cater to all aspects simultaneously. A typical lakehouse architecture, therefore, usually comprises a blend of diverse technology services, such as a serverless SQL service for ad hoc queries, a columnar store for fast reporting, a relational database for more complicated queries, and a time-series store for IoT and stream analysis, among others.

- Consider no-code or low-code tooling
    Depending on the user base, it might be beneficial to introduce a no-code or low-code tooling layer on top of the Gold layer. This would allow users to (self-service) transform data without needing to write notebooks or SQL queries.

- Add Apache Airflow for orchestration
    Depending on your organization’s requirements, you should consider adding Apache Airflow to orchestrate the data pipelines. You saw this in “Orchestration with Apache AirFlow”. This service can help automate the data pipeline, schedule jobs, and monitor the data processing.

- Feature engineering and machine learning
    Design your Silver and Gold layers to enhance feature engineering and experimentation for machine learning. This might involve adapting the design to include additional Lakehouse and Spark environments to support these activities.
